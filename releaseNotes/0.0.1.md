First release, this release should be used as a **testing release**. The objective is to have a working version so that we can use it and report any bugs or improvement ideas before 0.1. 

**New functionalities:**

* "Open", "Save", "Close" and "New" file options.
* Multiple open files at the same time (Diferent tabs).
* Realtime preview of how the markdown text would look like on web.
